This is a little script which will dump the secrets out of an Apple
keychain if you know the password. Look at extractkeychain.py for details.
You need to be running on OS X, since it uses Apple's 'security' command-line
util.

It uses the nifty pyDes code from Todd Whiteman 
(http://home.pacific.net.au/~twhitema/des.html) for DES - if that
seems to slow, you can easily switch over to pycrypto (two lines to change
in extractkeychain.py).
